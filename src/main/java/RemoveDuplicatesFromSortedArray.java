/**
 * Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order,
 * remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.
 * The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.
 * Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
 * <p>
 * Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
 * <p>
 * Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements
 * in the order they were present in nums initially.
 * The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
 * Return k.
 * Custom Judge:
 * <p>
 * The judge will test your solution with the following code:
 * <p>
 * int[] nums = [...]; // Input array
 * int[] expectedNums = [...]; // The expected answer with correct length
 * <p>
 * int k = removeDuplicates(nums); // Calls your implementation
 * <p>
 * assert k == expectedNums.length;
 * for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
 * assert nums[i] == expectedNums[i];
 * }
 * If all assertions pass, then your solution will be accepted.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Example 1:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [1,1,2]
 * Output: 2, nums = [1,2,_]
 * Explanation: Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 * Example 2:
 * <p>
 * Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4]
 * Output: 5, nums = [0,1,2,3,4,_,_,_,_,_]
 * Explanation: Your function should return k = 5, with the first five elements of nums being 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.
 * It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores).
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * Constraints:
 * <p>
 * 1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 104
 * -100 <= nums[i] <= 100
 * nums is sorted in non-decreasing order.
